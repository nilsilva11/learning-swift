# Learning Swift

This repository contains several small IOS apps I built while learning Swift &amp; SwiftUI.
It serves as a learning portfolio to practice building different apps and exploring SwiftUI concepts.

# Repository Structure
Each App is in its own folder with a README file explaining the app, its features and some screenshots.


## Technologies Used
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- SwiftData

I followed the Apple "Develop in Swift" tutorials to guide my learning:

Feel free to explore the apps, and any feedback is welcome :)
